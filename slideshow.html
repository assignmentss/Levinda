      { img: "slide0.jpg", notes: "Hello everyone. Thank you for joining me today. My presentation focuses on a consultancy project I conducted with Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital, a healthcare facility facing several operational and service delivery challenges. The project focused on assessing the hospital's situation, identifying its pressing needs, and developing practical, evidence-based recommendations to strengthen its performance. In this presentation, I will first provide an overview of the hospital and the issues identified, followed by the consultancy process, the key recommendations proposed, and finally, my reflections on the skills developed and lessons learned. By the end, I hope to demonstrate how the consultancy project provided solutions for the hospital and also supported my professional growth." },
      { img: "slide1.jpg", notes: "In this project, my client is Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital, established in 2007 in Port Harcourt (Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital, 2025). The hospital provides vital ophthalmology services to a large and growing population. Despite its importance, Lavinda faces key operational challenges that limit its effectiveness. These include delays in patient flow, frequent equipment malfunctions, limited digital presence, and budgetary constraints. Insights gathered through the staff survey revealed how these issues directly affect both performance and patient satisfaction. For example, slow patient flow and machine breakdowns have hurt the hospital's reputation and reduced patient trust. As such, there was a need to effectively address this challenges by designing reliable and attainable recommendations for Lavinda hospital." },
      { img: "slide2.jpg", notes: "The primary goal of consultancy project at Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital was to assess the root causes of the hospital's operational challenges and recommend practical, evidence-based solutions aligned with its vision for growth. After thorough assessment and research, three critical recommendations were developed. First, the hospital should implement a digital appointment and patient flow management system to enhance efficiency and reduce waiting times. Second, the hospital should establish a preventive maintenance protocol for essential equipment to minimize service interruptions. Finally, the hospital should launching a hospital website coupled with a basic digital marketing strategy to increase visibility and attract more patients." },
      { img: "slide3.jpg", notes: "This presentation is structured into three main sections. First, I will outline the final recommendations, supported by data-based analysis. The section will outline the expected benefits and impacts, along with a practical implementation plan tailored to Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital. Second, I will reflect on the consultancy process, highlighting the challenges encountered and how they were addressed, the skills developed, and the key lessons learned throughout the project. I will also present the conclusion and next steps, providing a roadmap for how Lavinda can move forward effectively to achieve sustainable improvement. The final aspect will be documenting the references that were essential in this entire presentation." },
      { img: "slide4.jpg", notes: "One of the most pressing challenges identified at Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital is the manual appointment system, which creates significant delays and bottlenecks in patient flow. This issue slows down service delivery and negatively affects patient satisfaction and overall operational efficiency. From the staff survey conducted, nearly 82% of respondents directly associated appointment availability with increased delays, as highlighted in Figure 1. These findings demonstrate that scheduling inefficiencies are a core driver of patient flow challenges. Therefore, introducing a digital appointment and patient flow management system will be a vital step. This solution will streamline scheduling, reduce waiting times, and enable better resource allocation, ultimately improving both patient experience and hospital performance." },
      { img: "slide5.jpg", notes: "Implementing a digital appointment and patient flow management system at Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital will deliver substantial benefits. Such systems, especially those enhanced by AI-based interventions, have been shown to optimise scheduling and ensure a smoother patient journey (Montazeri et al., 2020). By digitising and automating the process, Lavinda can significantly reduce waiting times, improve service delivery, and better align operations with patient demand. Evidence from Canada demonstrates that adopting digital and AI tools in healthcare has improved patient flow and appointment management, resulting in more efficient resource utilisation and higher patient satisfaction (National Centre for Biotechnology Information, n.d.). For Lavinda, these impacts would not only streamline operations but also build a reputation for reliability and efficiency." },
      { img: "slide6.jpg", notes: "Lavinda Eye Specialist Hospital has faced recurring challenges with equipment such as laser and phacoemulsification machines, often resulting in delays, cancelled procedures, and rescheduling chaos. The survey findings, shown in Figure 2, revealed that 100% of respondents linked equipment delays or malfunctions to disrupted appointments, underscoring the severity of the problem. To address this, Lavinda should not only rely on predictive maintenance but also establish preventive maintenance protocols. Preventive maintenance ensures routine inspections and servicing, which reduces unexpected breakdowns and extends equipment life. Studies confirm that hospitals implementing both preventive and predictive maintenance experience improved reliability, reduced downtime, and enhanced continuity of patient care. This dual approach will safeguard service delivery at Lavinda." },
      { img: "slide7.jpg", notes: "Establishing preventive maintenance protocols, alongside predictive maintenance, is a strategic step for Lavinda Hospital in addressing equipment-related delays and malfunctions. Research shows that both approaches are effective in reducing potential equipment failures and enhancing reliability in healthcare settings (Hardt et., 2021; Hamasha et al., 2023). Preventive maintenance is particularly valuable in mitigating costs when the risk of failure is low, making it a cost-efficient strategy. Evidence suggests that preventive maintenance can reduce costs by 12–18% and deliver nearly 400% return on investment (Brightly, 2023). For Lavinda, this means not only minimising disruptions to patient care but also optimising resource allocation and operational efficiency. Implementing such protocols ensures continuous, high-quality service delivery and patient satisfaction." },
      { img: "slide8.jpg", notes: "Lavinda Hospital currently operates without an active website or structured digital presence, which significantly limits its efficiency and patient engagement. However, the hospital relies heavily on manual appointment systems, which not only slow down service delivery but also frustrate patients. Our primary survey findings in Figure 1 revealed that 82% of respondents linked delays directly to appointment availability, underscoring this issue. The absence of a hospital website further reduces accessibility, transparency, and trust among patients. As such, launching a professional website and adopting a basic digital marketing strategy, Lavinda Hospital can streamline appointment booking, improve communication, and foster stronger patient relationships, ultimately enhancing overall service delivery and reputation." },
      { img: "slide9.jpg", notes: "Launching a hospital website combined with a structured digital marketing strategy will provide significant benefits for Lavinda Hospital. A strong digital presence is crucial for building patients' trust, engagement, and confidence in the hospital's services. Research highlights that digital marketing strengthens customer engagement, enhances brand image, and supports long-term sustainability (Kamyabi et al., 2025). By leveraging platforms such as social media, search engines, and email marketing, Lavinda can attract new patients while fostering loyalty among existing ones. The study by Park (2025) shows that nearly 65% of patients search online before booking an appointment or contacting a doctor, making a website essential for visibility. The study also depicts that 91% of patients expect responses within 24 hours, which can be effectively managed through online platforms" },
      { img: "slide10.jpg", notes: "Establishing a preventive maintenance protocol for equipment focuses on minimizing equipment breakdowns through structured maintenance protocols. In Phase 1–2, we will assess existing equipment and identify gaps, followed by vendor selection in Phase 3. By Phase 4, protocols will be developed, documented, and staff trained for seamless adoption. Hospital Management, vendor partners, and the maintenance team will lead this initiative. Required resources include vendor contracts, tracking tools, and training materials. The key risk is vendor delays, mitigated by engaging multiple vendors early and setting strict SLAs. This plan ensures improved equipment uptime and operational reliability." },
      { img: "slide11.jpg", notes: "The goal here is to improve patient flow, reduce wait times, and enhance service delivery through a digital appointment system. The implementation starts with Phase 1–2 which involves needs assessment, software selection, and customization. By Phase 3, we will pilot the system in one department, followed by staff training in Phase 5 and a full-scale rollout in Phase 6. Responsible stakeholders include the IT Specialist, Clinical Team, Project Lead, and an External Software Vendor. Resources required are software licenses, training modules, and IT support budgets. Risk includes staff resistance, mitigated by early orientation and continuous feedback. This system is expected to improve patient satisfaction and streamline operational efficiency." },
      { img: "slide12.jpg", notes: "Launching a hospital website and basic digital marketing strategy boosts the hospital’s digital presence and patient engagement. Phase 1–2 includes content gathering and website development. By Phase 3, the website will be launched, with Phase 4–6 dedicated to content optimization, SEO, and social media marketing. Key stakeholders include the IT Specialist, Marketing Team, and Consultancy Team. Resources involve website development funds, SEO tools, and a content creation team. The primary risk is delayed content approval, mitigated by assigning a dedicated approver and weekly progress checkpoints. This approach will enhance visibility, attract new patients, and support long-term growth." },
      { img: "slide13.jpg", notes: "The slide presents the main challenges I faced during the project and the solutions applied. The first challenge was limited data collection. Hospital staff were reluctant to participate in the survey due to time constraints, and the lack of digital records forced reliance on manual validation and follow-ups. To address this, I shortened the study, focused on clear closed-ended questions, and maintained open-ended options for deeper insights. I also worked closely with hospital administration to gain access to essential data. The second challenge was limited client engagement, as there was no project liaison." },
      { img: "slide14.jpg", notes: "I overcame challenge 2 by organizing weekly check-ins via phone calls and emails with different departments, which improved communication, sustained project momentum, and promoted clarity. The third challenge was a strategic one, arising from the gap between the hospital's needs and its available resources. Budget constraints highlighted by administration and staff limited the feasibility of several technology-based recommendations, particularly the development of a fully functional website. To overcome this, I conducted deeper research into cost-effective and scalable options. The solution was to explore free hosting platforms such as GitHub, which offered a practical alternative without straining financial resources. This approach ensured that the hospital could still establish a digital presence at minimal cost while maintaining flexibility for future upgrades. Ultimately, the strategy balanced resource limitations with the need for modernization, making the recommendations more realistic and sustainable." },
